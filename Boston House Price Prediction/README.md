**Boston House Price Prediction Project**
In this project I will develop an end to end prediction model to evaluate house prices from the boston house prices dataset.

In this repository you will find three files:

- Boston-House-Price-Prediction-Project: It is a detailed project development, data analysis and visualization, data transformation and some predictions.

- Valuation_Tool: Development of the price evaluation tool.

- boston_valuation: Python module with everything we developed to be able to import it and calculate the Boston house prices.
